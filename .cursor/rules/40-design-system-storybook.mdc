# Design System Rules

- tokens: primitive + semantic, light/dark, CSS variables build output.
- ui: tokens-based components, a11y defaults, variant/size/state standardized.
- storybook: autodocs enabled, keep stories updated; add play tests for interactions.
- Avoid duplicating component styles inside apps; improve tokens/ui instead.
