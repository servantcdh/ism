# SSOT & Priorities

- PROMPT.md is SSOT. If conflict, follow PROMPT.md.
- Priority order: TDD/tests first → performance → metrics pipeline → design system (tokens/ui/storybook).
- Do NOT change stack/architecture without updating docs/adr first.
- When unsure, read: CONTEXT.md, docs/LLM_RULES.md, PROMPT.md.

## Output expectations
- Propose a small, safe plan.
- Implement with tests (or same PR).
- Keep CI green.
