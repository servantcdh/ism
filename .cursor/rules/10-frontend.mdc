# Frontend Rules

- Stack fixed: React/Vite/TS + TanStack Query/Router/Virtual + Zustand + Axios + Jest.
- Server state in TanStack Query; UI state in Zustand.
- Use packages/ui components (avoid app-local component duplication).
- Prefer URL-synced state via TanStack Router for list filters/sort/page.
- Performance: virtualize large lists, debounce search input, prefetch detail when helpful.
- Metrics: keep web-vitals + custom marks flowing to POST /metrics.
